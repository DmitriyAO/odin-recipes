        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I thought I'd seen all there was to see when it came to pan-fried pork cutlets, but then I saw something called Katsu 
           'Mille-Feuille,'
        </p>
        <p>
            and I realized I hadn't seen anything yet. Okay, I'm being a little dramatic, but I really loved the 
            unusual look and feel, as well as the
        </p>
        <p>
            internal flavoring opportunities the multi-layer technique provides. I look forward 
            to seeing what you come up with! Served here with a salad and a squeeze of lemon on top.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li> 
            <li>4 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or as needed</li>
            <li>olive oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut tenderloin in half lengthwise. Place each half between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/8-inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Season pork with salt, pepper, and cayenne; spread a thin layer of mustard on top. Grate Monterey Jack cheese onto the pork.<br>
                Sprinkle parsley on top. Fold in the pointiest end 1/3 of the way. Fold in the sides. Give pork another fold; fold remaining <br>
                end on top. Flip cutlets seam-side down in the plastic wrap and lightly pound until flattened.
            </li>
            <li>Unwrap cutlets and season again with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Dust on all sides with flour until lightly coated. Place beaten <br>
                egg and bread crumbs in two shallow dishes. Dredge each cutlet in egg, then cover with bread crumbs. Let cutlets rest <br>
                for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat at least 1/4 inch oil in a pan over medium heat. Cook each cutlet until crust is browned and until meat springs back when poked, <br>
                4 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
