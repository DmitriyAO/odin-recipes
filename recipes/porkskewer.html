        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Street-style garlicky Thai pork skewers with lots of sweet and savory umami flavor. </p>
        <p>These are excellent broiled or grilled and served over rice noodles with nuoc cham dipping sauce,</p> 
        <p>on top of steamed rice with a fried egg, or in a sandwich with a slick of aoli and lots of fresh </p>
        <p>Thai herbs. Baking powder is traditional and gives the pork its signature bouncy texture.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground pork</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>wooden skewers, soaked in water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix together thoroughly. Dissolve <br>
                baking powder in 1 tablespoon water and blend completely into the pork mixture. Cover bowl with plastic <br>
                wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Thread a handful of the pork mixture through a skewer using lightly oiled hands. Shape meat into a 1-inch-thick <br>
                sausage around the skewer. Repeat with the remaining pork and skewers.</li>
            <li>Grill skewers, turning as needed, until browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. <br>
                Cut each sausage into bite-sized pieces before serving.</li>
