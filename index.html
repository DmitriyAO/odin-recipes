        <p>I thought I'd seen all there was to see when it came to pan-fried pork cutlets, but then I saw something called Katsu 
           'Mille-Feuille,' and I realized I hadn't seen anything yet. Okay, I'm being a little dramatic, but I really loved the 
           unusual look and feel, as well as the internal flavoring opportunities the multi-layer technique provides. I look forward 
           to seeing what you come up with! Served here with a salad and a squeeze of lemon on top.</p>
